# 🎁 GIFTD — The Thoughtful Gifting App

**Giftd** is a modern mobile-first web application that reimagines how we give and receive gifts — by focusing on **intentionality**, **shared experiences**, and **personal connection**.

This is not just another wishlist tool — it's a place for celebrating the little things, supporting the people you love, and capturing meaningful moments.
